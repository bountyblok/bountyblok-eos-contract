**Bountyblok EOSIO smart contract is powered by the bountyblok.io engine and will execute on chain the results of a completed challenge**

This will notify the external contract that implements the on_notify with the results of the challenge.

[bbreceiver.cpp](https://github.com/bountyblok/bountyblok-eos-contract/blob/master/bbreceiver.cpp) is an example of an external contract on how to define and implement the on_notify.
